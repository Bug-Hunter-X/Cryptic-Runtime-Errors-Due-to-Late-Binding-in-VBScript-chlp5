Early Binding:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Dim objFSO As Object
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  WScript.Echo "Error creating FileSystemObject: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
Else
  ' Use objFSO safely
  WScript.Echo "FileSystemObject created successfully."
End If
Set objFSO = Nothing
```
Error Handling: Always include comprehensive error handling using `On Error Resume Next`, `Err.Number`, and `Err.Description` to catch and handle potential errors gracefully.
